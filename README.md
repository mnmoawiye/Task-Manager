# Task-Manager

This is my final project on my WTCC javascript course. I created a simple task manager in javascript where the user can place tasks he wants to get down into my page, by putting the name, it's priority level, and if it is important or not. I was trying to make it user interactive and fun. On the first day I started out by doing the HTML. I used HTML to make the input field, the dropdown for priority, the checkbox for whether it was important or not, and a button to add tasks. I also started the javascript by using an array to store the task objects with properties like 'id', 'name', 'priority', 'isCompleted', 'isImportant', and 'date' inside the DOM. 

The second and third day was the one filled with majority of the difficulty and errors. First I started out by fixing the code from day 1. Day 1, the code was sloppy and the second day I fixed it. I also added many of the required features, such as preventing empty tasks names. After that I created the show tasks function. This function had many features. It used the .styles to apply base styles, add red to any important task, and applied the line-through for completed tasks. After I completed the javascript, I added a bit of CSS to try and brighten up the page. Overall, the project was pretty hard, but once I started understanding it became a little easier.
